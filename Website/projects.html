                <h4>A markdown and docx generator for offensive security</h4>

                <p>A large part of Penetration testing, and Vulnerability Assessment is creating reports. After all, it it the only outcome that has business use in risk management. However, it takes a lot of time and money to turn the raw data into something customer readable, and there is the risk of human error when churning out so many reports. This app will create markdown documents that can be edited in vim (or editor of choice) easily , in a formatted way. After filling out the document, it will be able to easily generate a dynamic, customer readable docx document using a template, and json file that can be updated without recompiling. This app reduced time, as well as prevented errors in creating Penetration testing, and Vulnerability Assessment. It was also later applied to Statement of Work Documents. Supports Windows and Mac OS.</p>
                <p>This app was created for Netsync Network Solutions, and thus no source code is available as I do not own it.</p>
